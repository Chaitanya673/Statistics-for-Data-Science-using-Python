# 1. Data and its Types
#### What is data?
Data is a set of collected or recorded facts of particular subject.

Data in general terms refer to facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis.

Types of Data:
#### 1. Qualitative Data
#### 2. Quantitative Data 

#### 1. Qualitative Data:
“Data Associated with the quality in different categories”. Data is measurements, each fall into one of several categories. (Hair Color, ethnic groups and other attributes of the population)

##### (a). Nominal Data: “With no inherent order or ranking”
~ Data with no inherent order or ranking such as gender or race, suck kind of data called Nominal Data.

##### (b). Ordinal Data: “with an order series”

#### 2. Quantitative Data: 
“Data associated with Quantity which can be measured”
~ Data measured on a numeric scale (distance travelled to college, the number of children in a family etc.)

##### (a). Discrete Data: “Based on count, finite number of values possible and value cannot be subdivided”
~ Data which can be categorized into classification, data which is based upon counts, there are only a finite number of values possible and values cannot be subdivided meaningfully, such kind of data is called Discrete Data.

##### (b). # Continuous Data: “measured on a continuum or a scale, value which can be subdivided into finer increments”
~ Data which can be measured on a continuum or a scale, data which can be have almost any numeric value and can be subdivided into finer and finer increments, such kind of data is called Continuous Data.
